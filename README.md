# Data Professionals Dashboard
This project set out to investigate the variations and disparities in the role of data professionals across different regions of the world. The data was obtained through a comprehensive survey led by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst"> @AlexTheAnalyst </a>, who gathered information from a diverse group of participants. To present this data, a dashboard was created that separates the information into two distinct sections. The first section presents location-based data such as salary, demographics, and background of the survey participants, while the second section presents their personal opinions and insights on the role of data professionals in their respective regions. This information was extremely useful in comparing and contrasting differences in salary, job demand, and other factors across different countries. This project not only provided valuable insights into the variations in the role of data professionals, but also highlighted the need for continued research in this area in order to understand and address any disparities that may exist.  Based on the findings of this project, it is clear that there are variations and disparities in the role of data professionals across different regions. The results of this study highlights the need for further research in this area in order to understand and address any disparities that may exist. It is my belief that in an increasingly data-driven world, it is important to ensure that data professionals are being treated fairly and given equal opportunities regardless of their location.
